### Abilities Dance Boston presents the fourth iteration of our Intersections series: highlighting BIPOC and disabled honorees past and present April 25th & 26, 2025

**04/25 08:00PM - 04/26 10:00PM @ Multicultural Arts Center**  
Abilities Dance Boston Honors Advocacy
Intersections Series Highlights Identities of Black, Disabled, Queer, and Transgender ArtistsAbilities Dance Boston (ADB) proudly presents the fourth iteration of its Intersections series, an innovative production that celebrates Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), deaf, disabled, queer, and transgender artists—past and present. Choreographed by Ellice Patterson, ADB’s Founder and Executive/Artistic Director, the ballet and modern dance showcase will take place on Friday, April 25, and Saturday, April 26, from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM at the Multicultural Arts Center, 41 Second Street, East Cambridge, MA 02141. A livestream will be available on April 26 only. Featured dancers include Cassandre Charles, Linda Lin, Claire Lane, Dara Capley, and Aiden Marshall.This year’s honorees—Finn Gardiner, Aubrey Smalls, Harmony Matthews, T.S. Banks, and Tom Wiggins—have made significant contributions across activism, the arts, and policy. The production transforms their life stories into movement and music, while also drawing connections to current legislative efforts in Massachusetts. Andrew Choe, Abilities Dance Boston’s Director of Music & Operations, has composed an original score inspired by their journeys.“Getting to know the honorees’ stories, work, and art—and translating them into music—means a great deal to me,” says Choe. “Projects like this are critical because they highlight narratives that are often overlooked while also raising awareness of the legislative policies that impact these communities.”Ellice Patterson adds, “We are thrilled to honor incredible figures, both ancestral and living, and to highlight that our identities as Black, disabled, queer, and transgender people have always existed and contributed to American history. No matter the federal landscape, we will continue to stand with our community, using artistry and advocacy to push for
liberation for all.”Abilities Dance Boston proudly partners with the Disability Policy Consortium and the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition to ensure the production remains informed by the legislative needs of marginalized communities.The organization transforms art into advocacy, using performance as a platform to amplify voices and drive social change. The Barr Foundation states, “In Massachusetts, ADB is simultaneously one of the most visible presenters of work from artists with disabilities, one of the leading employers supporting paid artists with disabilities, and one of the most vocal advocates for the rights and well-being of artists with disabilities.”General admission tickets are available for $35 by visiting https://ticketstripe.com/adbintersections25. To ensure accessibility, unlimited free and sliding-scale tickets are available so that financial barriers do not prevent attendance. Donations help subsidize costs and support equitable pay for artists and administrators.
