Come celebrate Juneteenth with a full day of culture, history, and community vibes!
Start with a free tour of the former governor’s mansion.
Bring your family, bring your friends — come eat, dance, learn, and honor the legacy of those who paved the way.Then head down to the lower lawn for a free cookout packed with lawn games, arts and crafts, dominoes, spades, a sensory garden for children of all abilities, live entertainment, free food, a free book fair, a caricature artist, and a chance to shop and show love to local entrepreneurs at our Black Vendor Market.
At 2:30PM, we’ll gather on the upper lawn for a special ceremony honoring the 12 individuals who were once enslaved on this very site nearly two centuries ago.
Then, from 3PM to 6PM, vibe with us to live music by The Christman Collective.
